# Vivitsa
  My operating system - from scratch!!!

Writing an operating operating system from scratch is fun. I am naming after
Sanskrit word Vivitsa meaning Desire of knowledge which is exactly why I started
this.


I am naming folders starting with number followed by what I did so that it is
easy to maintain chronology.

Operating system is targetting to run on x86 architecture, while devloping I am
using [Bochs emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bochs).

To build, run and test please use my 
[docker image](https://github.com/ragu-manjegowda/ragu-docker) by simply running

```shell 
	$ docker pull ragumanjegowda/docker
```
which has all the dependencies installed on it. I recommend running this image
on Ubuntu if you want to run emulator inside docker.
