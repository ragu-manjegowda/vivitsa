# Vivitsa
  My operating system - from scratch!!!

Writing an operating operating system from scratch is fun. I am naming after Sanskrit word Vivitsa meaning Desire of knowledge which is exactly why I started this.


I am naming folders starting with number followed by what I did so that it is easy to maintain chronology.

Operating system is targetting to run on x86 architecture, while devloping I am using [Bochs emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bochs).
